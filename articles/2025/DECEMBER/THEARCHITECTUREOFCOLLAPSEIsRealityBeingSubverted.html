        <p>In 1984, former KGB informant Yuri Bezmenov publicized a term called &quot;Ideological Subversion&quot;. This is basically a four-stage psychological warfare model designed to destroy a society from within. In this age of algorithmic radicalization, his framework is not outdated, rather it is a blueprint for modern &quot;Hybrid Warfare&quot;.</p>
<p>According to Bezmenov’s Love Letter to America (1984), &quot;subversion is a marathon, not a sprint&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demoralization (15–20 Years) -&gt; The moral and cognitive understanding of a generation is altered. Through education and media, &quot;factual truth&quot; is rendered irrelevant.</li>
<li>Destabilization (2–5 Years) -&gt; Subverting essential relations—economy, foreign policy, and defense.</li>
<li>Crisis (2–6 Months) -&gt; A cataclysmic breaking point involving a total breakdown of law and order.</li>
<li>Normalization (Indefinite) -&gt; The nation &quot;stabilizes&quot; under a new, often totalitarian, regime. The &quot;Useful Idiots&quot; who helped the revolution are typically the first to be eliminated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, as S. Aral notes in his book, The Hype Machine (2020), false information spreads 6x faster than the truth.</p>
<p>Employing Algorithmic Echo Chambers, digital platforms compress the &quot;Demoralization&quot; phase by multiple folds by reinforcing biases and solidifying societal polarization. The human brain is the new domain of war. Physical invasion is unnecessary when you can occupy a population's mind.</p>
<p>Both in East and West, the &quot;Active Measures&quot; described by Ladislav Bittman, are being redeployed through social networks. When a nation is fully demoralized, as Bezmenov warned, exposure to facts no longer matters.</p>
<p>We now badly need &quot;Media Literacy&quot;, to be able to treat every bit of incoming information as a potential means of manipulation. We should look at both sides of argument and multiple source to get an average understanding of the matter and shouldn't not act emotionally. We need to have an unified ethical code as psychological resistance to protect us from intrusion.</p>
<p>The &quot;Point of No Return&quot; is closer than it appears. Are we watching a &quot;Crisis&quot;, or are we living through a &quot;Normalization&quot;?</p>
